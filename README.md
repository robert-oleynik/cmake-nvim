# cmake-nvim

## Introduction

cmake-nvim integrates [cmake](https://cmake.org/) into [neovim](https://neovim.io/).
Using this plugin user can configure and build projects, define multiple cmake configurations and switch between build types.
This plugin is inspired by `vector-of-bool`'s [CMake Tools](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools) for `vscode`
